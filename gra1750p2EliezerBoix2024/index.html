			<section> <h3>instruction</h3><ol><li>Prep the chicken. Start by pounding the chicken breasts to an even thickness using a meat mallet. This way, the chicken cooks evenly. Afterward, season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
				<li>Cook. Sear the chicken in a large skillet over medium-high heat, until it&rsquo;s browned on both sides and cooked through. Keep the chicken covered under foil while you prepare your sauce.</li>
				<li>Make the sauce. Use the same skillet that you used to cook the chicken. Melt butter, then stir in garlic and flour. Add the spinach and artichokes, followed by the milk. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to scrape the stuck-on bits from the bottom of the pan.</li>
				<li>Add cheese. To finish the sauce, melt in both cheeses and season to taste. Once the sauce has thickened, stir in the sour cream.</li>
				<li>Combine and serve. Nestle the chicken into the sauce. Finally, sprinkle with red pepper flakes, and serve!</li>
				<li>Pound the chicken flat. Similar to chicken piccata, pounding the thick ends of the chicken breasts flat helps the chicken cook quickly and evenly in the pan</li>
				<li>Check the chicken for doneness. Chicken is cooked when the internal temperature reaches 165&deg;F The easiest way to check is with an instant-read thermometer.</li>
				<li>Can I use chicken thighs? Yes, chicken thighs work in this recipe. Unlike chicken breasts, you won’t need to pound chicken thighs flat beforehand. The cooking time might vary, so be sure to check that your chicken is done </li>
				<li>Use different cheese. As mentioned earlier, feel free to substitute tangy Neufchatel cheese with something milder, like cream cheese. You can also replace the parmesan cheese with Pecorino Romano or asiago cheese.</li>
